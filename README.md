Breakout board for the Cyclone 2 altera EP2C8

I could not find an altera cyclone 2 EP2C8 breakout board on the market. Due to this, I created my own. This way the altera cyclone 2 can be removed and connected to a programmer or jtag interface for debugging or programming while maintaining all normal functionality as it should. One of the things that I noticed was that the cyclone 2 uses a low voltage for some of the other fpgas out there. It runs between 1.15 and 1.25V so it is abnormal compared to the 3.3V that exists. This breaks out the io pins and interfaces.
